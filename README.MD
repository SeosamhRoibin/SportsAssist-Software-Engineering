In October we began brainstorming various potential concepts that we could
attempt to use the skills learned in our Software Engineering module as part of
our second year of B.Sc. Computer Science & Information Technology in NUI
Galway. Upon completing market research, technological evaluation,
conceptual modelling, we noticed a substantial gap in the current market for
an affordable, accessible, suite of tools to facilitate the efficient management
of sports teams.

Many sports teams at both the local and professional level rely on a vast array
of different platforms in order to achieve functions such as communication,
planning, tactical design, analysis, tracking of statistics, co-ordination of
training etc. however we noted that an accessible, lightweight platform to
achieve all these functions was largely absent from the current market and this
gave us the motivation to create our own.
